Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit others to whom the Software is
provided to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1. The copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
   copies or substantial portions of the Software.

2. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
   AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
   LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,

   SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

3. The Software may contain bugs or flaws in its implementation. While every effort
   has been made to ensure the Software is functional, no guarantee is made regarding
   its correctness, reliability, or performance. The authors do not provide any support
   or assistance and will not be held accountable for any potential issues that may
   arise due to the use of the Software.

4. If the Software is used in an environment where critical functionality or high
   availability is required (e.g., production systems, financial applications,
   medical devices, etc.), the user is advised to conduct thorough testing and
   validation before deployment. The authors disclaim all responsibility for any
   adverse outcomes that may arise from the use of the Software in such contexts.

## Key Considerations:

- **No warranty**: There is an explicit lack of warranty in the use of the software,
  highlighting that the software is "as is" and can have bugs, errors, or issues not
  covered by the authors.

- **Potential liability**: The license limits the authors' liability even in cases of
  damages resulting from using the software. This section safeguards the authors from
  any legal claims arising from the software's use.

- **Testing and Validation**: The addition emphasizes that users should thoroughly test
  the software, especially in environments where its failure could have significant
  consequences (such as in production systems).
